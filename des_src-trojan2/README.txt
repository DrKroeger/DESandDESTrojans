TROJAN 2 README
This is a sequentially trigger trojan. Two specific events have to happen to trigger
the trojan.
Trigger: Setting both switch 1 and switch 0 to zero with no other switches being set
         and no pushbuttons being pushed between the events.
Payload: Locks the Seven Segment Display (all segments on) and prevents reset.
