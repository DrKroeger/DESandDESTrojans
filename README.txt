DES PROJECT README
This project was done using the Digilent Nexys2 Development Board with the
Xilinx Spartan 3E -XC3S500-FG320 FPGA.

There are several different parts to this project first is the working DES
Implementation, which correctly implements DES encryption.
The other parts are trojans implemented using the DES Code. The code in these
folders has been modified so that when implemented in hardware the DES will
not function as expected.
